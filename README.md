  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>LocallySRCD uses the user's latitude and longitude to recommend small businesses near them. Users may "favorite" stores and leave reviews.</p>
  <p>This repo was forked from a product I worked on with a team. My contributions include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>modeled and implemented a non-relational database to store reviews</li>
    <li>expanded RESTful API to serve database requests</li> 
    <li>implemented reusable React form components for users to input new reviews</li>
  </ul>
